          <h1>Hey, thank you for visiting my site!</h1>
          <div>My name is Aleksandar Sultan  and I'm 23 years old. I wrote my first program on October 14, 2020 and from that 
              moment on, programming has become an integral part of my life on a daily basis. C # is the language in which I have 
              mainly written code so far, but I am open at any time to new challenges in other technologies and in different 
              parts of the professional field.</div>

          <p>I've often imagined what I would  answer to the question: "how I describe myself" and I came to the conclusion 
              that I can hardly be sure which aspects of my character I describe as more positive or more negative. That is why 
              I prefer judgment to be made by the other people. I describe myself as a person who adheres to discipline and
               accuracy, a positive and communicative personality. Sometimes I overdo with my persistence and meticulousness 
               in solving a problem, but this is mostly due to my obsessive desire to get every detail to perfectionism. </p>

          <p>What would my life be in 10 years? I imagine myself as a senior developer, interested in everything 
              related to programming, not only in technical terms, but as a way of communicating both collegially and 
              business-wise, as well as and friendly and emotionally, because I see in this profession a vocation that stimulates you 
              to build your life on the most valuable life principles - trust and empathy.</p>
